# RSSI-Dataset
This RSSI dataset is generated through WiFi fingerprinting in a 22 feet wide and 34 feet long indoor environment.
A smart phone is used as the navigating device, which scans the RSSI values from five access points and sends them to the server.
An android application is developed to scan these RSSI values, which uses the android.net.wifi.WifiManager class and sends them through URL to a computer having flask server implemented using python.
